# kore-anki

multi platform open source flashcards app

# why not anki

I have used anki in the past and really like it.
It have a lot of functions but it is not modern and ux is not good.

# why javascript?

- lot of packages
- easy to make it look modern
- can run in browser and be a desktop app (electron)

# features
- basic flashcards system
- responsive ui (to be usable on mobile)
- sync with dropbox
- downloading decks inside app
- easy to use


#### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build


```
